This is an alternative version of the original Umbra app that has been modified for lightweight deployment and lower hosting fees. Specifically, the collaboration service here is based on Hocus Pocus (not the original YSweet) and the deployment of this service is aimed at a VPS (cheapest DO Droplet) instead of the Cloudflare serverless/autoscaling setup from the original Umbra app. This is live and deployed at: https://umbra-collab.com/
